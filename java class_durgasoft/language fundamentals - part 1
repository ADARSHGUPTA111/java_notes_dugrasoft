java Lauange fundamentals :
________________________________

1. Identifiers
2. reserves
3. datatypes
4. literals
5. arrays
6. types of variables
7. varargs methods
8. main method
9. Command line arguments
10. Java Coding standards

______________
Identifier : 
______________
A name in java program is called identifier which can be used for identification purpose, it can be method name or variable name class name or lable name. 

e.g : 

class Test{
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int x = 10;
	}
}

Identifiers in above examples : 

1. Test, 2. main, 3. args, 4. String, 5. x

_______________________________________
Rules for Defining java identifiers
_______________________________________
1. only allowed character in java identifiers are.

 a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, '$', '_'

if we are using any other character we will get compile time error.

e.g total_number //is valid

total# //is invalid

2. identifiers can't start with digit.

total123 //is valid
123total //is invalid

3. java identifiers are case sensitive offcourse java language itself is treated as case sensitive programming language.

e.g class Test{
	int number = 10;
	int Number = 20;
	int NUMBER = 30;
}


we can differentiate with case

4. there is no length limit for java identifiers but it is not recommanded to take too lengthy identifiers

5. we can't use reserved words as identifiers

e.g int x = 10; is valid
int if = 20; is invalid(CE : if is reserved word).

6. all predefined java class name and interface name we can use as identifiers.

e.g class Test{
	public static void main(String[] arg){
		int String = 10;
		int runnable = 999;

		System.out.println(String);
		System.out.println(runnable);
	}
}

Output : 

10
999

even though it is valid but it is not a good programming practic because it reduces redability and creates confusion.

total_number 	//valid
total# 		//invalid
123total 	//invalid
total123 	//valid
ca$h 		//valid
_$_$_$_ 	//valid
all@hash 	//invalid
java2share 	//valid
Integer 	//valid
Int 		//valid
int 		//invalid

Reserved words in java:
__________________________

1. in java some words are reserved to represent some meaning or functionality such type of words are called reserved words.

  				    used 	unused	
				keywords(48)	keywords(2)



1. key words for data types

byte, short, int ,long, float, double, char, boolean

2. keywords for flow control
if, else, switch, case, default, do, while, for, break, continue, return

3. keywords for modifiers

public, private, protected, static, final, abstract, synchronized, native, strictfp(1.2), transient, volatile(,default).

4. keywords for exception handling

try, catch, finally, throws, throw, assert(1.4).

5. class related keywords.

class, interface, extends, implements, package, import, 

6. object related keywords

new, instanceof, super, this,

7. void return type keyword

in java return type is manidetory, if a method won't return anything then we have to declare that method with void return type.

but in 'C' language return type is optional and default return type is int.

8. Unused keywords

a. goto

usage of goto create several problems in old languages and hence sun people bane this keyword in java,

b. const

use final instead of const.

Note : goto and const are unused keywords and if we are trying to use we will get compile time error.

9. Reserved literals 

true, false values for boolean datatypes

null is default value for object reference.

10. enum(1.5) keyword

we can use enum to define a group of named constants. 

e.g enum Month{
	Jan, Feb, ...., Dec;
} 

enum beer{
	KF, KO, RC, FO;
}

conclusions

1. All 53 reserved words in java contains only lower case alpha bet symbols.
2. in java we have only new keyword and there is no delete keyword because 
   distruction of useless objects is responsibility of garbage collector

3. The follwoing are new keywords in java.

   1. strictfp(1.2)
   2. assert(1.4)
   3. enum(1.5)

4. strictfp but not strictFp
   instanceof but not instanceOf
   synchronized but not synchronize
   extends but not extend
   implements but not implements
   import but not imports
   const but not constant


Q. Which of the follwing list contains only java reserved words.

1. new, delete.
2. goto, constant.
3. break, continue, return, exit.
4. final, finally, finalize.
5. throw, throws, thrown.
6. notify, notifyAll.
7. implements, extends, imports.
8. sizeOf, instanceof.
9. instanceOf, strictFp.
10. byte, short, Int.
11. None of above.


Q. Which of following are java reserved words?

1. public 
2. static
3. void 
4. main 
5. string
6. args.
